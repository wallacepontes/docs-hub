# Documentation

There are several free diagramming tools available online. Some of the popular ones include:

1. **Lucidchart**: Lucidchart offers a free version with limited features but still powerful enough for many diagramming needs. It supports various types of diagrams including flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams, and more.

2. **Draw.io**: Now integrated into diagrams.net, it's a free and open-source diagramming tool. It's user-friendly and supports a wide range of diagram types. It can be used online or offline.

3. **Creately**: Creately provides a free version with limited features. It supports various types of diagrams including flowcharts, org charts, mind maps, and more.

4. **Gliffy**: Gliffy offers a free version with basic features. It's easy to use and supports a variety of diagram types.

5. **Cacoo**: Cacoo has a free version with limited features. It supports real-time collaboration and offers various templates for different types of diagrams.

6. **Google Drawings**: Google Drawings is a part of Google Drive and is free to use. While not as feature-rich as some other tools, it's good for basic diagramming needs and integrates well with other Google services.

7. **PlantUML**: If you're looking for a tool specifically for creating UML diagrams, PlantUML is a good option. It's a free, open-source tool that allows you to write diagrams using a simple textual language.

These tools vary in terms of features, user interface, and supported diagram types, so you may want to try a few to see which one best suits your needs.

## Haiku Documentation

Haiku Documentation is a way of writing software documentation that follows the structure of Haiku poetry. The goal of Haiku Documentation is to make the documentation more concise and easy to understand. In this style of documentation, the first line describes the problem or feature, the second line describes the solution or design, and the third line describes the benefits or trade-offs.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR) 

Architecture Decision Records (ADR) is a way to document important architectural decisions made during a software development project. The ADRs are usually plain text files that are kept in version control, alongside the codebase. They capture the context, decision and its consequences in a clear and concise way. ADRs are used to document decisions that have significant impact on the system, such as major design choices, technology choices, and organizational decisions. They provide a clear and concise record of the reasoning behind the decisions, and make it easier for future developers to understand the design of the system and the reasoning behind it.

## 4+1 architectural view model

The 4+1 architectural view model is a way to describe the architecture of a software system using five different views, each one focusing on a specific aspect of the architecture. The five views are:

1. Logical View: This view describes the system's functionality from the perspective of the users and the business domain. It shows the main components of the system, the relationships between them, and the main use cases.

2. Process View: This view describes the runtime behavior of the system, focusing on the interactions between the components and the flow of control. It shows how the system's functionality is implemented and how the different components work together.

3. Physical View: This view describes the physical deployment of the system, including the hardware and software components, the network infrastructure, and the security considerations.

4. Development View: This view describes the organization of the codebase and the development process. It shows how the system's functionality is implemented in the code and how the different components are organized and developed.

5. Scenario View: This view describes the system's behavior in a specific scenario, such as a failure or a high-load situation. It shows how the system responds to different inputs and conditions, and how it handles exceptional situations.

The 4+1 architectural view model provides a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of a software system by considering different aspects of the architecture from different perspectives.

## Which documentation  should generated a Solution Architect?

A Solution Architect is responsible for designing and overseeing the implementation of technical solutions that meet the needs of an organization. As part of this role, the Solution Architect may be required to generate a range of documentation to support the design and implementation of the solution.

The specific types of documentation that a Solution Architect may be required to generate will depend on the nature of the solution and the needs of the organization. Some common types of documentation that a Solution Architect may be responsible for creating include:

- Solution design documents: Detailing the technical design of the solution, including components, dependencies, interfaces, and data flows
- Architecture diagrams: Visual representations of the solution design, showing the relationships between components and the overall structure of the solution
- Technical specifications: Detailing the requirements for each component of the solution, including performance, capacity, security, and other technical considerations
- Implementation plans: Outlining the steps and tasks required to build and deploy the solution
- Test plans: Describing the tests that will be performed to ensure that the solution is functioning as expected
- User manuals: Providing instructions for users on how to use the solution
- Maintenance and support documentation: Detailing the processes and procedures for maintaining and supporting the solution after it has been deployed.
