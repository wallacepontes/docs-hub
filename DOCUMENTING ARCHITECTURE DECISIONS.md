# DOCUMENTING ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

Here is a summary of the article:
[DOCUMENTING ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

The article proposes a lightweight method for documenting architecture decisions in software projects. Architecture decisions are the choices that affect the structure, behavior, and quality of a system. They are often implicit, undocumented, or forgotten over time. The article suggests that architecture decisions should be recorded as text files in a version control system, along with the code. Each decision file should have a simple and consistent format, such as:

- Title: A short phrase that summarizes the decision
- Status: The current state of the decision, such as proposed, accepted, deprecated, or superseded
- Context: The background and motivation for the decision
- Decision: The actual choice that was made
- Consequences: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision

The article also provides some examples of decision files and some benefits of using this method, such as:

- It helps to communicate and justify the decisions to other stakeholders
- It provides a historical record of the evolution of the architecture
- It facilitates the review and evaluation of the decisions
- It supports the reuse and adaptation of the decisions in other projects

The article concludes by recommending some best practices for documenting architecture decisions, such as:

- Use a simple and consistent naming convention for the decision files
- Keep the decision files concise and focused
- Link the decision files to other relevant documents, such as requirements, design, or code
- Update the decision files when the status or consequences change
- Review the decision files periodically and remove or revise the obsolete ones
