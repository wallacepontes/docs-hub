# Diagrams as code

## [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/c4.html)
Mermaid is a tool that allows you to write diagrams as code and it is easy to set up and integrates with VS Code, markdown and GitHub. 

It works offline and has various diagrams including flow charts, gantt charts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, git diagrams, and entity relationship diagrams. 

However, it has limited configuration settings and the syntax can be difficult to remember at times.

B --> C{Decision}
C -->|One| D[Result 1]
C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```


```mermaid

      Enterprise_Boundary(b0, "BankBoundary0") {
        Person(customerA, "Banking Customer A", "A customer of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")
        Person(customerB, "Banking Customer B")
        Person_Ext(customerC, "Banking Customer C", "desc")

        Person(customerD, "Banking Customer D", "A customer of the bank, <br/> with personal bank accounts.")

        System(SystemAA, "Internet Banking System", "Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts, and make payments.")

        Enterprise_Boundary(b1, "BankBoundary") {

          SystemDb_Ext(SystemE, "Mainframe Banking System", "Stores all of the core banking information about customers, accounts, transactions, etc.")

          System_Boundary(b2, "BankBoundary2") {
            System(SystemA, "Banking System A")
            System(SystemB, "Banking System B", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts. next line.")
          }

          System_Ext(SystemC, "E-mail system", "The internal Microsoft Exchange e-mail system.")
          SystemDb(SystemD, "Banking System D Database", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")

          Boundary(b3, "BankBoundary3", "boundary") {
            SystemQueue(SystemF, "Banking System F Queue", "A system of the bank.")
            SystemQueue_Ext(SystemG, "Banking System G Queue", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")
          }
        }
      }

      BiRel(customerA, SystemAA, "Uses")
      BiRel(SystemAA, SystemE, "Uses")
      Rel(SystemAA, SystemC, "Sends e-mails", "SMTP")
      Rel(SystemC, customerA, "Sends e-mails to")

      UpdateElementStyle(customerA, $fontColor="red", $bgColor="grey", $borderColor="red")
      UpdateRelStyle(customerA, SystemAA, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetX="5")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemAA, SystemE, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetY="-10")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemAA, SystemC, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetY="-40", $offsetX="-50")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemC, customerA, $textColor="red", $lineColor="red", $offsetX="-50", $offsetY="20")

      UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow="3", $c4BoundaryInRow="1")

## PlantUML

> Configurar Extensão PlantUML
> 1. PlantUml: **Render** = Local
> 2. PlantUml: **Server** = https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml

PlantUML is more complex to set up than Mermaid as it requires a server to create diagrams. It offers more configuration settings and supports more types of diagrams than Mermaid, including use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and JSON data visualization. However, it requires sending data over the internet to a server, and the website is outdated.

If you're looking for a tool specifically for creating UML diagrams, PlantUML is a good option. It's a free, open-source tool that allows you to write diagrams using a simple textual language.

```plantuml
@startuml
abstract        abstract
abstract class  "abstract class"
annotation      annotation
circle          circle
()              circle_short_form
class           class
diamond         diamond
<>              diamond_short_form
entity          entity
enum            enum
exception       exception
interface       interface

protocol        protocol

## recommends
Overall, the speaker recommends Mermaid if you are looking for an easy-to-use diagramming tool that integrates with VS Code and markdown. If you need a more extensive diagramming tool with lots of control, then PlantUML is a good choice. Finally, if you have limited diagramming needs and want a really easy-to-use tool, then HackerDraw is worth considering.
